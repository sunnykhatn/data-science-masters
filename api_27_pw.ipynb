    "Q1: What is an API? Give an example where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "Answer: An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs specify the methods and data formats that applications should use to request and exchange information, facilitating seamless interaction and integration between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life example: An example of API usage is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to embed maps, directions, and location data into websites and mobile apps. Ride-sharing apps like Uber or Lyft use the Google Maps API to provide real-time maps and directions to drivers and riders."

    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation: APIs can automate workflows by enabling software components to communicate without manual intervention.\n",
    "Efficiency: APIs allow applications to use complex functions in the background, making it easier for developers to build robust solutions.\n",
    "Integration: APIs enable seamless integration with other software, providing additional functionality and features.\n",
    "Scalability: APIs allow applications to scale by supporting multiple clients, enabling broader use of services.\n",

    "Q4: Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) Architecture: REST is an architectural style for networked applications, often used for building Web APIs. RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all necessary information for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Architecture: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in a web service, using XML as the message format. It follows strict standards, supporting complex data types and built-in error handling, making it suitable for enterprise-level applications.\n",

    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP's strict structure and XML-based messaging increase complexity, leading to slower processing.\n",
