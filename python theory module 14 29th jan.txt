1. Who developed Python Programming Language?
Answer: Guido van Rossum
2. Which type of Programming does Python support?
Answer: Python supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Procedural Programming, and Functional Programming paradigms.
3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?
Answer: Yes, Python is case-sensitive. Variable names like myVariable and myvariable are considered different.
4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?
Answer: The standard extension for Python files is .py.
5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?
Answer: Python code is interpreted. This means the code is executed line by line, without a separate compilation step.
6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?
Answer: Some common code blocks in Python include:
Functions: Defined using the def keyword.
Classes: Defined using the class keyword.
Conditional statements: Using if, else, and elif.
Loops: Using for and while.
7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?
Answer: The # character is used for single-line comments.
8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?
Answer: You can use the following functions to check the Python version:
sys.version: Returns a string containing the version information.
platform.python_version(): Returns the version number as a string.
9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called
Answer: Python uses lambda expressions to create anonymous functions.
10. What does pip stand for in Python?
Answer: pip stands for Pip Installs Packages. It's a package manager used to install and manage third-party Python packages.
11. Mention a few built-in functions in Python?
Answer: Some common built-in functions include:
print(): Prints values to the console.
len(): Returns the length of a sequence (e.g., string, list).
input(): Gets user input from the console.
int(), float(), str(): Converts values to integer, float, or string, respectively.
max(), min(): Returns the maximum or minimum value in a sequence.
12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?
Answer: There's no strict limit on the length of identifiers in Python, but it's generally recommended to keep them reasonably short and descriptive for readability.
13. What are the benefits of using Python?
Answer: Python offers several benefits, including:
Readability: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand.
Versatility: It can be used for various tasks, from web development to data analysis.
Large community: A strong community provides extensive support and resources.
Cross-platform compatibility: Python runs on multiple operating systems.
Extensive libraries: A vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks is available.
14. How is memory managed in Python?
Answer: Python uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory. This means the interpreter reclaims memory for objects that are no longer in use.
15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?
Answer:
Download the Python installer from the official website (python.org).
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
During installation, make sure to check the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Python from the command line anywhere on your system.
16. Is indentation required in Python?
Answer: Yes, indentation is crucial in Python. It's used to define code blocks and control the flow of execution. Consistent indentation is essential for correct programÂ behavior.
